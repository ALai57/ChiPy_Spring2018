1) Query, ingest, load - (JN 1)
2) Preprocessing - (JN 2)
3) Train Test Split + Modeling - 

Preprocessor as a class to store... mean, etc

Start with goals for notebook


pip installable ("extensions")

Table of contents

Python have something like R studio? Just started
Jupyter lab - notebook extension with TOC - Scratchpad

Develop packages for a team

Sample data set sampled down to 100 data points or so....

Start with Logistic Regression
Random forest predicts better, because of non-linear behavior

Genie Index - how atoms order in a crystal lattice

Random forest - feature importance
Do I need to take these out of the dataset?

Numpy vectors for lin alg only - pass data frames to the actual function
Fine to pass pandas data frames

Confusion matrices
Box example - 1,0 0,1 -- most often care about the ones you get WRONG - 


Look into why the import didn't work???

INstall library to view Jupyter

AUTORELOAD - look into this
PDB - look into this

Use PDB with scratchpad

My goals:
implement ridge regression
Categorical to continuous regression...? 

Demonstrate that I can replicate code in SKlearn
Try to build a cool UI out of these...
